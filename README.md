# Odin Recipes
Odin recipes is a website with recipes of dishes. On main page you can see a list of recipes. If you click on each of the recipe title you will be redirect to page dedicated for this recipe.

During creating this project i learned How to add some basic html element to webpage. I created a website with main page and four recipe pages. On main page i created list of links ("a" element) to recipe pages. On each recipe page i included image of finished dish, short description of dish, unordered list of ingredients and ordered list of steps to make dish.
